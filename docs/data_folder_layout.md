# here's how to organize your 'data' folder that is passed into CortProcessor

Mandatory: 3 folders named, named 'tdt', 'angles', 'pose-3d'

tdt should be containing all the experiment files got directly from TDT. if using camera control, the live videos should be placed directly in there.

angles and pose-3d should be taken directly from anipose.

Note, subject names in TDT must not contain hyphens or underscors. i think this will break it.
